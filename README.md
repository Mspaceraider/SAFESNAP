SafeSnap is a novel lens for Snapchat Spectacles that is designed to guide individuals during natural disasters and other emergency situations by 
leveraging the cutting-edge capabilities of SnapAR Spectacles. Our project focuses on simulating the navigation of an earthquake as a proof of concept, showcasing how AR technology 
can provide valuable guidance in critical moments and save lives. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a staggering 58% of Americans believe that running for 
doorways or exiting buildings is the safest course of action during an earthquake. In reality, the correct response is to drop, cover, and take shelter under solid furniture like tables 
or other sturdy surfaces. Despite the prevalence of earthquake risk, especially in areas around California's San Andreas Fault, only 34% of U.S. residents have received proper training to 
adequately handle such emergencies. This knowledge gap puts countless lives at risk during these unanticipated disasters. SafeSnap addresses this discrepancy in knowledge by providing 
real-time emergency instructions directly through the SnapAR Spectacles, guiding users to take precise actions during an earthquake. The lens visually and audibly informs users of their 
safest immediate actions, helping to prevent common mistakes and potentially reduce fatalities. In future iterations, SafeSnap will utilize machine learning models to detect and highlight 
secure locations in real-time, offering a more dynamic response system that adapts to various disaster types. Additionally, it will allow for simulated training so that users can train and 
prepare before disaster strikes. By combining AR technology with life-saving information, SafeSnap is a crucial tool for improving disaster preparedness and response times, especially in 
natural disaster-prone regions. SafeSnap empowers individuals to make the safest choices when it matters most.
